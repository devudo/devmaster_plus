DevShop Hosting
===============

Installation
------------

DevShop is built on top of Aegir, and consists of two projects:
devshop_provision (backend) and devshop_hosting (front-end).

DevShop Provision also requires the provision_git drush module.


1. Install Aegir

  DevShop assumes a base Aegir installation.
  See http://community.aegirproject.org/handbook to learn about Aegir.

  The most reliable and generally supported way to install aegir is with
  the Debian packages.

  See http://community.aegirproject.org/installing/debian for instructions on
  installing in debian based systems like Ubuntu.  Pay close attention to

2. Install provision_git and devshop provision

  $ drush dl devshop_provision provision_git

  In a typical debian environment, it will try to download it to
  /usr/share/drush/commands, but you can put it anywhere Drush command files can live.

3. Install devshop_hosting and enable desired modules.

  Download devshop_hosting and ctools into your @hostmaster site with drush:
  $ drush @hostmaster dl devshop_hosting ctools

  Enable devshop_projects, devshop_tasks, devshop_log, and optionally,
  devshop_tasks and devshop_tests:

  $ drush @hostmaster en devshop_projects devshop_tasks devshop_log devshop_tests

NOTE: The project creation wizard requires certain Hosting Tasks to run before
later steps can be completed. For this reason, it really helps to have a very
fast Hosting Queue, or to install the Hosting Queue Runner project (http://drupal.org/project/hosting_queue_runner) so that tasks fire as quickly
as possible.

4. Connect to your private Git repositories.

DevShop allows you to clone your projects via the web based interface.  In order
to do this, you must first make sure your DevShop/aegir server can connect to
your repository.

Setup SSH keys so that your aegir user can git clone your repository.  The first
time you clone an SSH repository, you have to type "Yes" for security purposes.

Once you can connect and clone, you no longer need to use the command line to
create new platforms on your aegir server.
